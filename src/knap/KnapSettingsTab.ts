/**
 * The one screen the rebuilt client has: an account, a cloud vault, and how
 * that vault is doing.
 *
 * It exists because the commands were the only way in, and a command palette
 * is where somebody looks after they already know the thing is there. Asked to
 * try the beta, the first thing a person does is open Settings and look for a
 * button, and in a beta build the relay's own tab is hidden, so they found
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * **Two rows and a strip, in the order they depend on each other**: Account is
 * who, Cloud vault is what this vault syncs with, and the strip under it is how
 * that vault is going. The strip was the first thing on the screen until
 * 2026-09-02, floating above the two rows as if it were a third subject; it is
 * a fact about one cloud vault, so it now sits inside that row's block, sharing
 * its border, and it appears only where there is a link.
 *
 * The Cloud vault row is a name and nothing else. The sentence about a delete
 * travelling both ways moved to the screen that links (#116 put it here, and
 * where it belongs is where somebody is choosing rather than on a row they
 * read every week).
 * There is no server field (ADR-0033), no scope picker (ADR-0043), and no
 * second kind of member to set (ADR-0034). There is also no Change button:
 * linking somewhere else is Unlink and then Choose, which is what happens
 * underneath either way, and a third button to say so is a third button.
 *
 * The strip is the only thing on the screen that folds. That is the hierarchy:
 * the dot and the word are always out, the size sits beside them, and the
 * counts behind them come out when somebody asks. Nothing deeper is kept here
 * at all. What went wrong in detail is on the server, and the device only ever
 * tells it four content-free facts (ADR-0071).
 *
 * Signed in, there is always a way back out. A screen that can only sign in is
 * one a person cannot hand their laptop on from, and the only alternative was
 * uninstalling the plugin, which leaves the token alive anyway.
