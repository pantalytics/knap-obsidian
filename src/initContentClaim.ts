 * claim (TR-15, #1c52a010; TTL/reclaim + real-signal settle added in a
 * follow-up round after Bill/Daedalus's 2026-07-24 hold on PR #58).
 *
 * Two clients opening the SAME newly-shared folder for the first time (typical
 * team onboarding) can both observe an empty relay-side Y.Text and both insert
 * their local file's content — Yjs has no causal link between the two inserts,
 * so it merges them as two contiguous blocks instead of one (duplicated text).
 *
 * Fix shape: claim a slot in a shared Y.Map, give a concurrently-connecting
 * client's own claim a settle window to arrive over the relay, then let only
 * the deterministic winner (Yjs Y.Map's built-in last-writer-wins conflict
 * resolution converges every replica on the SAME winning clientID once both
 * claims have been exchanged) perform the insert. The loser never inserts —
 * it picks up the winner's content via ordinary CRDT sync once it arrives.
 *
 * A claim now carries a timestamp and is reclaimable: if the client that won
 * the claim dies/disconnects before `insert`/`markInitDone()`, the original
 * design pinned CLAIM_KEY to that dead clientID FOREVER — no future client,
 * including a fresh session, could ever win the claim again, so the document
 * silently never got seeded. `claimInitIfUnclaimed` now re-claims a stale
 * claim (dead per awareness, or just old per the TTL) instead of treating any
 * existing claim as final.
 *
 * Callers: `claimInitIfUnclaimed` immediately, then `awaitClaimSettled` (a
 * real signal, not a fixed delay — see its own doc comment), then
 * `wonInitClaim`.

 * itself going quiet: as long as `meta`'s CLAIM_KEY keeps changing (a
 * competing client is still reclaiming/arriving), we keep waiting; once it's
 * been quiet for `quietMs`, we treat the race as settled. A fixed
 * `maxWaitMs` ceiling still bounds the worst case (e.g. a flapping doc) the
 * way it does in `waitForBufferFlush` — the flush wait and the quiet-period
 * wait share ONE deadline computed from `maxWaitMs`, not two independent
 * budgets, so a stalled socket can't silently double the documented ceiling
 * by burning a full `maxWaitMs` in each phase.
 *
 * In the common (non-racing) case this also resolves faster than the old
 * fixed 1000ms — it only waits out one quiet period, not a blanket delay.
