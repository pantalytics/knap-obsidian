/**
 * The socket pool, against a network that runs out of sockets like a browser.
 *
 * Issue #115, measured on 2026-08-31: a vault of 2612 notes filled to 297
 * and stopped, with 258 connections to the server that never moved again,
 * because every note opened a websocket and none of them ever closed. A
 * renderer gets 255 of them, and the 256th handshake does not fail: it waits
 * in a queue nobody answers, so the note that asked for it waits forever and
 * every note behind it waits on that.
 *
 * So the fake network here has a ceiling and goes quiet above it, exactly
 * the way the real one did. The claims are about what the client does under
 * that ceiling: it never holds more sockets than the pool allows, a fill of
 * more notes than a browser has sockets runs to the end, two vaults in one
 * process both fill, and a note is never closed until what was written into
 * it has reached the server.
 *
 * Real `WebsocketProvider`s over a real y-protocol exchange, because the
 * thing under test is when a socket exists, and a fake provider would decide
 * that question itself.
