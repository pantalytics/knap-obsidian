/**
 * Which of Obsidian's own settings files travel with the cloud vault.
 *
 * The rule is a denylist, and that is deliberate: *settings* means the theme,
 * the hotkeys, the snippets **and the plugins** to the person using Obsidian,
 * which is also what Obsidian Sync means by it. A feature that answered a
 * narrower question than its own label would need explaining every time
 * somebody noticed their plugins had not followed (ADR-0094).
 *
 * This file is the plugin's half of a format two repositories read. The
 * server's half is `is_synced_config` in `knap_mcp/providers/filesystem/paths.py`
 * and the two carve-out lists have to say the same thing, or a device offers a
 * file the server answers 422 to and a person reads a sentence about a file
 * they never put anywhere.
 *
 * Pure, no Obsidian imports, so jest reaches every branch.

 * it came from, so the name is fixed on both sides; the alternative is "any dot
 * directory that is not one of these", which is not a rule anybody can check by
 * reading it. A vault with a renamed config directory syncs its notes and
 * attachments exactly as before.
 *
 * The repo's own lint rule warns about this line, and the warning is left
 * standing rather than silenced: it is the right warning for anybody who finds
 * this constant without the paragraph above it. `ObsidianConfigStore` walks
 * `vault.configDir` like the rule asks, so a renamed directory yields no path
 * this predicate accepts and that vault's settings stay where they are.
