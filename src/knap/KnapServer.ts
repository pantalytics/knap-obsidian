/**
 * The Knap server, as the plugin speaks to it (ADR-0073, the rebuild).
 *
 * One server, known at build time (ADR-0033), and one credential: the token
 * the sign-in flow minted. Five conversations, and nothing else:
 *
 * - the sign-in exchange: a one-time code in, the plugin's token out
 * - the sign-out: the token handed back, so it stops opening anything
 * - which cloud vaults this account may open, and what it may do there
 * - how large an attachment this deployment takes
 * - the address of a document's sync socket
 * - attachments, up and down, as plain bytes
 *
 * There is no per-document token, no rate-limited token route and no
 * control plane behind this: the server that answers is the server that
 * holds the documents, and the whole authorisation story happened when the
 * socket or the request presented the one token.
 *
 * `fetch` is injected so tests hand in a fake and Obsidian hands in its
 * own; the module never touches a global.
