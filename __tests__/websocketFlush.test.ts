/**
 * Unit tests: waitForBufferFlush (TR-51, #1cf58421)
 *
 * The bug: syncDocumentWebsocket used to `await new Promise((r) =>
 * setTimeout(r, 1000))` after writing a reconcile update, hoping that was
 * enough time for the WebSocket to flush it before an intentional disconnect
 * proceeded. On a slow link or a large diff, the update can still be sitting
 * in the socket's outgoing buffer well past a fixed 1000ms — these tests
 * simulate exactly that (a buffer that drains slowly over several polls) to
 * prove the fix actually waits for the real signal instead of a guessed
 * delay, and that it's still bounded so a stuck/closed socket can't hang
 * forever.
 *
 * Uses a fake `{ bufferedAmount }` object (a duck-typed WebSocket stand-in) —
 * no real WebSocket/network boundary involved, so nothing here needs mocking
 * beyond the object under test's own dependencies (sleep/now are injected).
