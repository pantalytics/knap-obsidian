/**
 * An editor that asked for a note before its socket had synced.
 *
 * `openNote` turns such an editor away, on purpose: an editor bound to a
 * document that is still empty would offer the file's text to fill it. What
 * it did not do was say when to ask again, so the editor waited for its own
 * next update, and on 2026-09-20 a phone typed into an empty page in the
 * meantime (issue #169). `whenSynced` is the answer to "when".
