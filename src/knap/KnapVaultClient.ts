/**
 * One linked cloud vault, live: the tree, the notes an editor has open, and
 * a small pool of sockets that every other note takes its turn in.
 *
 * A local vault is linked to at most one cloud vault (ADR-0066), so a client
 * holds exactly one of these. Two documents earn a socket of their own and
 * keep it: the tree, because that is how creates, moves and deletes travel,
 * and a note somebody has open in an editor, because a caret cannot live on
 * a socket that comes and goes. Every other note borrows one.
 *
 * The pool is not tidiness. Chromium allows 255 websockets per renderer and
 * then queues the 256th handshake in silence rather than failing it, and
 * Obsidian is one renderer for every vault window on the machine. Measured
 * on 2026-08-31: a vault of 2612 notes filled to 297 and stopped there, with
 * 258 established connections that never moved again, and a second vault
 * opened in the same Obsidian got its tree socket and nothing else, which
 * reached the person as "could not reach server" over a sign-in that had
 * worked (issue #115).
 *
 * The wire is untouched. This is which sockets exist and for how long.
 *
 * The WebSocket implementation is injected: Obsidian hands in the platform's,
 * tests hand in `ws` or one of their own. y-websocket syncs same-process docs
 * over a BroadcastChannel behind the server's back, which phase 0 caught as a
 * false pass, so it is off everywhere and the wire is the only path.

/**
 * How many notes may hold a socket at once, beside the tree and whatever an

 *
 * Low on purpose. The ceiling to stay under is 255 per renderer, and the
 * things sharing it are not this vault's business: a second vault in the
 * same Obsidian, a popout window, a phone that is stricter than any desktop
 * browser. Eight leaves a linked vault costing about ten sockets while it
 * fills, so a machine can hold a dozen of them and still be nowhere near the
 * ceiling. It is also enough concurrency to matter: a fill runs eight notes
 * deep instead of one, and the round trips overlap.
 *
 * Raising it buys a faster fill and spends the headroom that this whole
 * change is about, so it stays a constant with a reason rather than a
 * setting somebody can turn into the bug again.
