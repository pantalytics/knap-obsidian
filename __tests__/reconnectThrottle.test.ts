/**
 * Tests for TR-12's HasProvider reconnect throttle math.
 *
 * Found during independent review: HasProvider.ts's connection-error
 * handler used to call connect() with zero delay, implicitly bounded by
 * the same wsUnsuccessfulReconnects/maxConnectionErrors counter that
 * capped provider.ts's OWN backoff loop at 3 attempts. Once that counter
 * was uncapped (TR-12's main fix), this handler had NO throttle left at
 * all — a fast-failing connection (DNS refusal, immediate rejection)
 * could call connect() in a tight, un-backed-off loop forever. This
 * throttle restores a floor: never fire more than once per
 * maxBackoffTime.
