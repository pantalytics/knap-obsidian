/**
 * Waiting for a reconcile update to actually leave the local send buffer
 * before an intentional disconnect proceeds (TR-51, #1cf58421).
 *
 * BackgroundSync used to wait on a fixed 1000ms timer after writing a
 * reconcile update to the Y.Doc, hoping that was enough time
 * for the WebSocket to hand the bytes off to the network before
 * disconnecting. On a slow link or with a large diff, the update can still
 * be queued in the socket's outgoing buffer well past a fixed 1000ms —
 * disconnecting at that point drops it silently.
 *
 * The Yjs sync protocol used here has no per-update delivery ack (only the
 * initial sync handshake reports "synced"), so the best available in-protocol
 * signal is `WebSocket.bufferedAmount`: it tracks bytes queued but not yet
 * handed off to the network, and only reaches 0 once everything written so
 * far has actually left the local buffer. That's not a server-side ack that
 * the relay *received* the update, but it directly scales with diff size and
 * link speed — which a fixed timer cannot — so it replaces the guess with a
 * real, measurable signal.
