/**
 * Idempotent "who gets to be canonical for this brand-new vpath" claim
 * (TR-15-follow-up, #7c14871a).
 *
 * TR-15 (initContentClaim.ts) fixed a race where two clients opening the
 * SAME newly-shared folder both insert into an already-shared, already-
 * identified empty Y.Text. SharedFolder.uploadDoc()/uploadCanvas() have a
 * DEEPER version of the same race: for a vpath neither client has seen
 * before, SyncStore.new() mints the file's `guid` as a random uuidv4() into
 * `pendingUpload`, a per-DEVICE `LocalStorage` — never a Y.Map, never
 * replicated to peers. Two clients racing on the same new vpath each mint a
 * DIFFERENT guid before either publishes to the shared `meta` map, so
 * initContentClaim.ts's guid-keyed claim has nothing to claim ON — the two
 * clients aren't even contending for the same key.
 *
 * This claims the vpath itself, one level up, on the SharedFolder's OWN
 * already-synced `ydoc` (not a per-document Y.Doc, which doesn't exist yet
 * for the loser) — same claim→settle→decide shape and TTL/awareness-reclaim
 * logic as initContentClaim.ts, generalized to a Y.Map of many keys (one
 * per racing vpath) instead of a single fixed key, since many files can be
 * discovered new at once (e.g. initial sync of a folder with pre-existing
 * local files on both sides).
 *
 * Callers: `claimVpathIfUnclaimed` immediately, then `awaitVpathClaimSettled`,
 * then `wonVpathClaim`. The loser never mints/publishes its own guid for
 * this vpath — see SharedFolder.adoptWinnerDoc/adoptWinnerCanvas.
