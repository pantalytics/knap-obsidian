/**
 * One open editor, bound to one note's live document.
 *
 * The binding in `VaultBinding.ts` keeps files and documents equal, and it
 * is deliberately coarse: Obsidian saves a note a second or two after the
 * typing stops, so that is how often a keystroke can reach anybody else. A
 * cursor cannot live on that clock. A caret drawn from a document that is
 * two seconds behind the editor sits in the wrong sentence, and a remote
 * paragraph that arrives as a whole-file write lands under somebody's hands
 * while they are typing.
 *
 * So for as long as a note is open in an editor, the editor is bound to the
 * document directly: every keystroke goes in as a difference (ADR-0010, the
 * same rule the server writes under), every remote change comes back as a
 * difference, and the file binding stands down for that one note until the
 * editor lets go. Nothing here replaces a document or a file wholesale.
 *
 * Deliberately framework-light: it takes anything with CodeMirror's `state`
 * and `dispatch`, which is what an Obsidian editor is, and what a test can
 * be without a screen. The CodeMirror plugin that drives it lives in
 * `knapEditor.ts`.
