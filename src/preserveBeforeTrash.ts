/**
 * Pure decision logic for TR-42 (#121a9874): before a remote-delete cleanup
 * trashes a local file, decide whether it has unsynced edits worth
 * preserving as a conflict-copy instead of letting them be silently
 * destroyed.
 *
 * Extracted dependency-free (no Document.ts/pocketbase import) so it's
 * directly testable — SharedFolder.ts/Document.ts transitively pull in the
 * ESM-only `pocketbase` package, which breaks ts-jest parsing (the same
 * wall y-diffMatchPatch.ts, sharedFolderNesting.ts, and websocketFlush.ts
 * were extracted around). See SharedFolder.preserveUnsyncedDocumentBeforeTrash
 * for the I/O side (reading the vault file, writing the conflict copy).

 * Returns the LAST match by iteration order, not the first. Callers backed
 * by a `Map` iterate in insertion order, and a map that's never pruned on
 * a remote delete (SharedFolder.files is exactly this) can end up holding
 * more than one entry for the same path if it's deleted and recreated more
 * than once in a session — the most recently inserted entry is the live
 * one; an earlier entry at the same path is a stale orphan.
