/**
 * Where everybody's cursor is in one note, on awareness and nowhere else.
 *
 * A cursor is not a fact about a vault: it is true for as long as somebody
 * is looking at a line and false a second later, so it rides awareness, the
 * y-protocol's side channel, and never enters the document. Knap's server
 * forwards it, hands it to a device that opens the note later, and drops it
 * when the socket closes, all without writing a byte (ADR-0076 in the admin
 * repository, measured in its `scripts/spikes/cursor_presence/`).
 *
 * Positions travel as Yjs **relative** positions rather than offsets. An
 * offset is only true against one version of the text: somebody typing
 * above your caret would drag it a word to the left on every other screen.
 * A relative position names the character the caret sits on, so it stays
 * put while the note moves under it, which is the whole trick behind a
 * cursor that reads as another person rather than as a jumping artefact.
