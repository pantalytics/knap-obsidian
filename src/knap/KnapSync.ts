/**
 * The orchestrator: sign-in, the link, and the running binding, as state.
 *
 * A local vault is linked to at most one cloud vault, linking replaces
 * rather than appends, and Unlink ends the link without deleting anything
 * on either side (ADR-0066, ADR-0047). This class is that sentence as
 * code: `link` tears down whatever ran before it starts the new binding,
 * and `unlink` stops the sockets and clears the remembered vault while the
 * sign-in survives, because the account and the link are different facts.
 *
 * `signOut` is the other direction of the same distinction: the account
 * goes, and the link goes with it, because a link is to a cloud vault of
 * the account that is leaving. Holding one without a token would be a
 * settings row that says this vault syncs with something it can no longer
 * reach, and that is how a device ends up showing somebody else's folders.
 *
 * Unlink and sign out also throw away what this device remembered of the
 * cloud vault's tree. Both say on screen that nothing is deleted anywhere,
 * and a kept record would make a later relink start by deleting whatever
 * was removed here in between. No memory means no deletions, which is what
 * linking has always done.
 *
 * Persistence goes through two callbacks rather than a settings object, so
 * the host (Obsidian's data.json in production, a dict in tests) stays out
 * of the engine.
